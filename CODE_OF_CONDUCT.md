# Code of Conduct for Contributors

## Our Promise

We, as members, contributors, and leaders, commit to making participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sexual characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socioeconomic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We commit to acting in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behaviors that contribute to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Respecting different points of view and experiences
- Accepting constructive criticism gracefully
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behaviors include:

- Use of sexualized language or imagery and unwanted sexual attention
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Posting private information about third parties, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and should take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and to communicate the reasons for moderation when necessary.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces. Examples of project representation include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as a designated representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or unacceptable behavior can be reported by contacting the project team at cleber.demgoncalves@gmail.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality regarding the reporter of an incident. More details about specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions, as determined by other project leadership members.
