# -O-id

**-O-id** is a lightweight and efficient library for creating custom Web Components, focusing on simplicity and performance. Built entirely in JavaScript, **-O-id** ensures that your components are fast, lightweight, and easy to maintain. With an intuitive architecture and decorators like `@paint` and `@repaint`, developing reactive and modular components becomes simple and straightforward.

## Why -O-id?

The name **-O-id** is inspired by Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytic theory. The "**id**" represents the most primitive part of the human personality, driving our fundamental instincts. Similarly, the **-O-id** library serves as an essential foundation for building web interfaces. The suffix "**-O**" symbolizes the transformation of ideas into tangible resultsâ€”functional and efficient components.

**-O-id** is not just a tool but a force driving interface creation, allowing developers to transform concepts into reality in an agile and intuitive way. This name highlights the importance of starting with a solid foundation, just as the "**id**" is the starting point in personality formation.

## Installation

To install the library, use npm:

```bash
npm install @bake-js/-o-id
```

> **Note:** The library is also compatible with `yarn` and `bun`.

## Usage Example

Below is a simple example of how to use the library to create an interactive counter:

```javascript
import { define } from '@bake-js/-o-id';
import { css, html, paint, repaint } from '@bake-js/-o-id/dom';
import on from '@bake-js/-o-id/event';

function component(self) {
  return html`
    <button>Increment ${self.number}</button>
  `;
}

function style() {
  return css`
    button {
      background: hsl(${(self.number * 30) % 360}, 100%, 50%);
      border-radius: 8px;
      color: #222222;
      cursor: pointer;
      font-size: 16px;
      font-weight: 600;
      line-height: 20px;
      padding: 10px 20px;
      border: 1px solid #222222;

      &:hover {
        background: hsl(${(self.number * 30) % 360}, 50%, 50%);
      }
    }
  `;
}

@define('o-id-counter')
@paint(component, style)
class Counter extends HTMLElement {
  #number;

  constructor() {
    super();
    this.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' });
  }

  get number() {
    return (this.#number ??= 0);
  }

  @repaint
  set number(value) {
    this.#number = value;
  }

  @on.click('button')
  increment() {
    this.number += 1;
    return this;
  }
}
```

You can view the interactive example on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/demgoncalves/pen/dyxpdLw?editors=1010).

### Component Explanation

The example illustrates the creation of a custom element component named `o-id-counter`, representing a counter that can be incremented via a button. Below are the key features of the component:

- **Element Definition:**
  - The element is defined as `o-id-counter` using the `@define` decorator, and it uses Shadow DOM to encapsulate its styles and structure.

- **Internal State:**
  - The counterâ€™s state is stored in a private property `#number`, starting at zero. The `get number()` method returns the current value, while the `set number(value)` method allows updates.

- **Component Rendering:**
  - The `component(self)` function generates the HTML structure for the button, and the `style()` function defines the applied CSS styles.

- **Interactivity:**
  - The `increment()` method is decorated with `@on.click('button')`, allowing the counter to be incremented with each button click. This method updates the state and re-renders the component automatically.

### How to Use

To use this component in your application:

1. Ensure the code is properly imported and defined.
2. Add the `<o-id-counter></o-id-counter>` element anywhere in your HTML.
3. The component will be ready to use, incrementing the value with each button click.

Example of usage in HTML:

```html
<o-id-counter></o-id-counter>
```

> This example demonstrates how **-O-id** simplifies the creation of interactive components with a clear and efficient syntax.
